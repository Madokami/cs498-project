Environment setup
- Install python 3.8 or later
- Install alpaca python API with "pip3 install alpaca-trade-api". 
  - More instructions can be found on https://github.com/alpacahq/alpaca-trade-api-python

Create config.ini with your API key, secret, and API endpoint. This will be needed by the python API for authentication.
config.ini should look like the following:
[profile]
APCA_API_KEY_ID=<YOUR_KEY>
APCA_API_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET>
APCA_API_ENDPOINT=https://paper-api.alpaca.markets

Setup a cronjob to run alpaca_trader_run_hourly.py:
On the raspberry pi, this can be done with "crontab -e" adding the following line:
35 6-12 * * 1-5 python3 /home/pi/workspace/alpaca-trade/alpaca_trader_run_hourly.py

The above line will setup the script to run every hour from 6:35 to 12:35 on every weekday between Monday and Friday.
